## About

AI coding agents (OMP, Codex, Cursor, Aider, and others) excel at implementation but struggle with project-level context — conventions, structure, and intent. This template bridges that gap by baking best practices directly into the project skeleton. Ships with `AGENTS.md`, pre-configured CI, code quality thresholds, and documentation templates, so agents can contribute effectively from day one.

## Features

| | |
---|---:|
 **Agent-aware project structure** — Standardized layout with `AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md` patterns, and agent skills integration. AI coding agents can navigate and contribute effectively from day one. | **Ready-made CI workflows** — Opinionated GitHub Actions pipelines for linting, type-checking, testing, commit linting, changelog enforcement, and file size policy — no configuration required. |
 **Code quality thresholds** — Module size guidelines, function length limits, nesting depth rules, and module export counts built into project documentation. Quality gates enforced by CI. | **Two adoption paths** — Designed for both greenfield projects (via `SETUP_GUIDE.md`) and existing repositories (via `ADOPTING.md`). Incrementally adopt only what you need. |
 **Devcontainer configuration** — Pre-configured `.devcontainer/` with everything in place for VS Code Dev Containers or GitHub Codespaces. | **Documentation templates** — `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/agent-files-guide.md` included and pre-formatted. |
 **Conventional commit enforcement** — CI rejects commits that don't follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Branch naming follows [Conventional Branch](https://github.com/nickshanks347/conventional-branch). | **Tiger Style principles** — Built-in engineering guidelines for high-reliability systems: assertions, bounded operations, zero tech debt. |

## Getting Started

 New Project | Existing Project |
